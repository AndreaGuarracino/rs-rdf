# rdf-rs

> Note: This project is work in progress and currently not stable.

`rdf-rs` is a library for the [Resource Description Framework](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) (RDF) and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) implemented in Rust.

This project is a way for me to learn Rust and combine it with my interests in semantic web technologies.


## Roadmap

- [x] Provide the basic structure for representing graphs, triples, nodes, ...
- [ ] Implement Rdf writer and support some common formats
- [ ] Implement Rdf parser for some formats
- [ ] Support querying with SPARQL
